                                            <font color=black>Hi, my name is Amy, I’m a 27 year old Fitness Coach from Bondi (here’s me training, here’s me in Bondi). <br> <br>

When I first started working out many years ago, my goal was to lose body fat (especially on my stomach and thighs), to reduce cellulite and to gain muscle shape and definition. As you may have heard, exercise is important but a healthy diet is the true key to changing your body shape. <br> <br>

However, every time I planned to follow a healthy diet, I would be on track for a while. Then eventually, usually at night after dinner, I would have a craving for dessert foods (I have a big sweet tooth). Or even if I didn’t have a craving, I would be tempted by the junk food other people ate around me (people brought cakes into the office for birthdays, my partner snacked on chocolate right next to me, and my friends and family wanted to dine out and order dessert. One of my lovely friends is also amazing at baking delicious desserts. Damn it.) <br> <br>

Of course, sometimes I had enough willpower to say no. But in my experience, it only takes caving in just once to derail a whole diet.<br> <br>

Sometimes, I would have ‘just a piece’ and then slowly I would slip into ‘just another piece’ and before I knew it, I had over-eaten and broken my promise to myself of starting a new healthy diet. And often once we break the diet just once, we start doing it more frequently. We go through an entire period of eating badly. I believe it is because we have given ourselves permission just once to cheat on our diets. So it’s easy to say – why stop at one? It becomes habitual. And over time, we are proving to ourselves that we can’t stick to a diet so ‘why even bother’. We stop believing in our ability to stick to a diet and we feel guilty.<br> <br>

In short, I really wanted to meet my goals of getting into my best shape ever, but it was becoming so difficult to rely on self-control, because if it fails just once, we slip into a habit of bad eating.<br> <br>

However, even though the treats were delicious, I knew that if I wanted to get serious and get into the best shape of my life, I needed to eat healthy food at least 90% of the time. I couldn’t keep breaking my healthy diet plans. I needed consistency for at least a few months so I could start seeing some results.<br> <br>

Then one day, I was craving a chocolate dessert after dinner. Instead of going to buy a chocolate or an ice-cream, I looked online for a quick healthy dessert recipe. I had tried healthy desserts a few times before, so I was skeptical that it would taste very good. But to my surprise, it turned out really well (my partner must have agreed, because by the morning, it was gone haha).<br> <br>

After that it became a habit. Whenever I became tempted or had cravings, I made a healthy dessert or healthy fast food instead. Over the years, I have tried many recipes and I know what tastes great (and not so great) and I have created healthy versions for each of my cravings (from melted chocolate or peanut butter cravings to burgers, macaroni cheese, salted caramel ice cream, donuts, french fries, cheese and beyond).<br> <br>

To this day, this trick is what helps me to reach my fitness goals – it stops me from craving junk food, prevents me from derailing my diet plans, allows me to still enjoy delicious desserts and most importantly has helped me to stick to healthy eating and get into the best shape of my life. I have been able to reduce my body fat, increase my muscle, improve my body shape and add definition without skipping desserts and I am the healthiest I have ever been.<br> <br>
